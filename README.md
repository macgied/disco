# disco

disco is an iOS Music Social app created by me, Megied Alkassab, during my final semester in Computer Science at the University of Vienna.

I uploaded the source code here on Github for future students who might want to pick up where I left off.

The iOS app can be run on a Mac with the OSX built in Simulator application. But I strongly encourage anybody who is serious about User Expercienc to install it natively onto their mobile device to get a genuine feeling for app testing. I can't tell you how many hours I have spend adjusting things because they seemed alligned on my computer screen, but ended up just a tiny bit to the left or right on my iPhone.

### Resources and requirements needed for installing **_disco_** onto your device:
* 🖥 Computer running Mac OSX 10.10.5 or newer
* 🛠 Xcode 7 or newer
* 📱 iPhone 6/6s running iOS 9 or newer
* 🔄 Lightning cable to sideload the app via Xcode to your iPhone

## Installing Disco on your iPhone
1. Open the Terminal application on your Mac and type the following command:  
 `git clone https://github.com/macgied/disco.git`  
  This command will copy all the relevant files from my GitHub Disco repository onto your computer.  
2. Now locate manually the folder named “disco” or use Terminal:  
   `cd disco`  
3. And launch the Xcode project manually or via Terminal:  
`open disco.xcodeproj`  
4. Compile in Xcode and run the app in Simulator or deploy it onto the iPhone.
