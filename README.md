# disco

disco is an iOS Music Social app created by Megied Alkassab during my final semester in Computer Science at the University of Vienna.

I uploaded the source code here on Github for future students who might want to pick up where I left off.

The iOS app can be run on a Mac with the OSX built in Simulator application. But I strongly encourage anybody who is sersious about User Expercienc to install it natively onto their mobile device to get a genuine feeling for app testing.
